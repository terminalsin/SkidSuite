### Obfuscation

| Tool  | Description  | Price | Link |
|-------|--------------|-------|------|
| **Allatori** | Allatori is a decent obfuscator and has a demo readily available, so for that alone its a good goto. You can't beat free.  | <ul><li>Demo: Free</li><li>Full: $290+</li></ul> | [Allatori](http://www.allatori.com/) |
| **DashO** | DashO is a step above Allatori in almost every department. The flow obfuscation is more noticable than in some other obfuscators, the string encryption is more dynamic, and it has more features overall. | <ul><li>Trial: 1 Week </li><li>Full: Varies, [~$2000](https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/~collberg/Teaching/620/2008/Assignments/tools/DashO/) </li></ul> | [DashO](https://www.preemptive.com/products/dasho/overview) |
| **Dexguard** | Dexguard is an Android application obfuscator, supports all the common features plus a few extra Android-specific abilities.  | <ul><li>Full: Varies</li></ul> | [Dexguard](https://www.guardsquare.com/en/products/dexguard) |
| **DexProtector** | DexProtector is another Android application obfuscator made by Licel (developers of Stringer). | <ul><li>Demo: Requires company verification</li><li>Full: Varies</li></ul> | [DexProtector](https://dexprotector.com/) |
| **Excelsior JET** | **DISCONTINUED** Technically not an obfuscator, as it is actually an ahead-of-time compiler. Still, reversing native code is effectively obfuscation in comparison to reversing java code.  | <ul><li>Full: $3,000</li><li>Personal: Conditionally free</li></ul> | [Excelsior JET](https://www.excelsiorjet.com) |
| **JNIC** | JNIC is the little brother of Excelsior in the means of how they operate. JNIC, instead of focusing on providing direct Bytecode modifications, converts all instructions to JNI files. It's usage is much trickier than the usual however such provides a great layer of protection. | <ul><li>Demo: Free 1 week with only 1 method/project allowed to be converted</li><li>Full: +$100</li></ul> | [JNIC](https://jnic.dev/) |
| **Jfuscator** | Aside from the fact that it can't support anything past Java 7, its about on par with DashO. String obfuscation is dynamic enough to basic skids. Flow obfuscation works, but isn't that strong. | <ul><li>Demo: Free 2 weeks</li><li>Full: $599 + _(optional $195 support)_</li></ul> | [Jfuscator](https://secureteam.net/jfuscator) |
| **JObf** | JObf is an open source obfuscator by superblaubeere27. | <ul><li>Free</li></ul> | [jobf](https://github.com/superblaubeere27/obfuscator) |
| **Paramorphism** | Paramorphism contains several specific techniques to subvert the functionality of mainstream reverse-engineering tools. It employs multiple techniques beyond what you normally see _(string / flow obf)_ to prevent decompilation and modification. There's also a [discord](https://discord.gg/k9DPvEy) chat. | <ul><li>Full: $100</li></ul> | [Paramorphism](https://paramorphism.dev/) |
| **Proguard** | Proguard is one of the most common obfuscators out there. It's one of the oldest and most imporantly, its totally free. It really only supports name obfuscation and not much else. Ironically, you can use it on obfuscated jars to weaken name obfuscation into something more workable. You can check the source code on [github](https://github.com/Guardsquare/proguard). | <ul><li>Free</li></ul> | [Proguard](https://www.guardsquare.com/en/products/proguard) |
| **Radon** | Radon is an open source obfuscator by ItzSomebody | <ul><li>Free</li></ul> | [Radon](https://github.com/ItzSomebody/Radon) |
| **Scuti** | Scuti is an open source obfuscator by netindev. | <ul><li>Free</li></ul> | [Scuti](https://github.com/netindev/scuti) |
| **Branchlock** | Branchlock is one of the newest obfuscators in the field. Despite it's simplistic site and the fact it's entirely based online, it provides a decent obfuscation comparable with Paramorphism. Their crashing strategies were first of a kind but are starting to become more and more prevalent amongst obfuscators. It's currently one of the cheapest obfuscator available. | <ul><li>Demo: Free, limited to 40% of flow and certain functionalities</li><li>Full: $75</li></ul> | [Branchlock](https://branchlock.net) |
| **qProtect** | qProtect is a new semi-private obfuscator on the market. It's currently sold exclusively via discord. It's currently the cheapest obfuscator available. | <ul><li>Full: $50</li></ul> | [qProtect](https://mdma.dev) |
| **Stringer** | Stringer is an unweildy beast in a few regards. The flow obfuscation on high settings is really strong and the string encryption can't be statically reveresed without a LOT of effort _(Essentially requires emulation)_. It boasts some other neat features others don't have like resource protection and reflection obfuscation. Sadly the cooler features are locked away under the enterprise license which I cannot find any information about online. Just assume it costs an arm and a leg.  | <ul><li>Demo: Requires company verification</li><li>Non-Enterprise: $3,000+</li><li>Enterprise: Varies</li></ul> | [Stringer](https://jfxstore.com/stringer/) |
| **yGuard** | yGuard is similiar to proguard in that its more of a code-shrinker than of an obfuscator. But hey, its free. | <ul><li>Free</li></ul> | [yGuard](https://www.yworks.com/products/yguard) |
| **Zelix Klassmaster** | Zelix is another oldie, and their website shows it. Despite the outdated website Zelix is another strong obfuscator with good string and flow encryption. Its consistently updated and works for recent versions of Java such as 11. For the features it gives the smallest license is an absolute steal. | <ul><li>Demo: Free, requires company email</li><li>Full: $240+</li></ul> | [Zelix Klassmaster](https://www.zelix.com/klassmaster/index.html) |
